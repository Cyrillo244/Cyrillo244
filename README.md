- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning deep learning and building models that help solve medical problems and other business problems.
-  I recently built a chatbot / virtual assistant that provides round-the-clock customer support, enabling customers to get answers to their queries at any time, even outside of business hours.
